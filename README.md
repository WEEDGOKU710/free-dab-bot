# free-dab-bot
the most og mIRC based weed script for your dabbing pleasure

This is the most OG mIRC script for doing tokes and dabbing. There is no better bot for it. This is known and agreed upo across the globe. Some idiots call this a "sync script" which doesn't make no sense but call it whatever you want. It is open source so you can make it better and let it live on forever.

Coming soon: Perl (irssi) script, bash/zsh addon for "timer" function only (for use in -nix terminals), C console program, X based Linux quartz timer

PS the files are in different branches you BAKA!!!
